# Customer-review analyst with LangChain + LLMs
This project introduces an AI-powered customer-review analyst agent that automates the analysis of customer feedback using LangChain and LLM (OpenAI GPT model in this project). <br>
By transforming raw customer reviews into structured insights — such as summaries, sentiments, emotions, and personalized responses — businesses can save valuable time, reduce manual workload, and increase customer satisfaction. <br> 
With suggested email replies auto-generated for each review, service teams can engage customers more promptly and consistently, strengthening loyalty and trust. <br>
The project also shows how with LangChain, we can extract business-relevant insights and auto-generate customer service responses at scale instead of using ChatGPT on ad-hoc basis.

## Project 

The dataset is taken from Kaggle: Sephora products and skincare reviews.  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews
<br>
I've taken only a few samples of reviews for the Vegan milk moisturizer product to test. <br>

Here we start building a scalable and automated workflow for customer review analysis.
Below code sets up a structured way to analyze customer reviews, which can then be scaled to analyze all reviews in your dataset. <br>

This is my favourite part - a super elegant and powerful line. 
Its a LangChain expression language to make pipelines, in this case, it formats the reviews into a prompt for LLM and the LLM process the prompt into a raw response, which is then parse into a structure output. <br>

**chain = prompt | llm | parser** <br> <br> <br>

Next we set up a function to loop through every review and produce a standardized output. <br>

After running the analysis, you’ll see new columns added to your dataset:
summary, highlights, sentiment, emotions, business_insights, recommended_action, and email. 
The original review text remains in the review_text column, while the new columns are generated by the LLM. <br>

Among these, the email column is especially time-saving — it contains a customized draft response tailored to each individual review. <br>
Unlike generic, copy-paste replies often used in customer service, these AI-generated responses add a personal and thoughtful touch, enhancing how your brand engages with customers on social media and review platforms. <br>

Furthermore, the results can be used for reporting, dashboarding, follow-ups, monitoring product and customer satisfaction trends and even for A/B testing.
