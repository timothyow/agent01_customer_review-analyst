# Customer-review analyst with LangChain + LLMs
This project introduces an AI-powered customer-review analyst agent (01) that automates the analysis of customer feedback using LangChain and LLM (OpenAI GPT model in this project). <br>
### Impact and Use Cases
Traditional sentiment analysis stops at classification — here an AI agent takes it further by:
- Helping customer service teams scale personalized replies
- Allowing brands to *close the feedback loop* in real-time
- Improving customer satisfaction through timely, empathetic responses
- Saving hours of manual reading, tagging, and drafting replies <br>

As the agent can now conduct an end-to-end workflow, from raw customer reviews into structured insights — summaries, sentiments, emotions, and personalized responses (or more) — it marks a shift from passive analysis to prescriptive recommendations. <br> 
The project also highlights how with LangChain, we can extract insights and auto-generate responses at scale instead of using ChatGPT on ad-hoc basis. This provides a path towards scalable agents embedded into real business workflows. 

**Before**: Manual review by analyst + conduct sentiment analysis + understand customer's situation + drafted email reply <br>
**After**: Agent01 reads → interprets → replies, all automatically (or having a human-in-the-loop where needed)

## What the customer-review analyst does
1. Summarizes customer reviews
2. Extracts key highlights (positive or negative)
3. Detects review sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
4. Identifies customer emotions/sentiment
5. Auto-generates email replies based on sentiment

---

## Business applications
- Identify product issues & improvement areas
- Automate customer feedback response
- Track sentiment & emotion trends over time
- Prioritize negative feedback for escalation

## Project 

The dataset is taken from Kaggle: Sephora products and skincare reviews.  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews
<br>
I've taken only a few samples of reviews for the Vegan milk moisturizer product to test. <br>

Here we start building a scalable and automated workflow for customer review analysis.
Below code sets up a structured way to analyze customer reviews, which can then be scaled to analyze all reviews in your dataset. <br>

This is my favourite part - a super elegant and powerful line. 
Its a LangChain expression language to make pipelines, in this case, it formats the reviews into a prompt for LLM and the LLM process the prompt into a raw response, which is then parse into a structure output (modified to business requirements). <br>

**chain = prompt | llm | parser** <br> <br> <br>

Next we set up a function to loop through every review and produce a standardized output. <br>

After running the analysis, you’ll see new columns added to your dataset:
summary, highlights, sentiment, emotions, business_insights, recommended_action, and email. 
The original review text remains in the review_text column, while the new columns are generated by the LLM. <br>

Among these, the email column is especially time-saving — it contains a customized draft response tailored to each individual review. <br>
Unlike generic, copy-paste replies often used in customer service, these AI-generated responses add a personal and thoughtful touch, enhancing how your brand engages with customers on social media and review platforms. <br>

Note that the outputs (highlights, summary, recommendations, insights, etc) could be modified as per business requirements. 
Individually, these outputs might not be perfectly accurate but if its analyzed at scale across hundreds/thousands of reviews, they will reveal meaningful insights that can lead to impactful recommendations. <br>
Furthermore, the outputs can be modified to be used for reporting, dashboarding, follow-ups, customer satisfaction trends or A/B testing. <br>
