9334422659,3,0,,0,0,0,3/17/2023,I can't wait to be out of this. This breaks me out and does not work under makeup at all. It's okay at best. It's literally on par with drugstore moisturizers.,Skip,fairLight,green,dry,brown,P453253,Vegan Milk Moisturizer,MILK MAKEUP,38

It's a nice moisturizer, but you can maybe can a cheaper one with similar qualities.",Nice Product,,brown,combination,blonde,P453253,Vegan Milk Moisturizer,MILK MAKEUP,38
1048276344,5,1,1,2,0,2,12/28/2022,I have combo skin and am currently battling breakouts. I tried using this on my face but it felt heavy. I decided to use it on my nails and it works fantastic! It healed and repaired my cuticles and left my nails looking great. It has shea butter and grape seed oil so that must be one of the reasons. I ended up reaching for this instead of my LâOccitane Nail & Cuticle Oil and now that it's done I'm finding it hard to go back.,USE IT ON YOUR CUTICLES,lightMedium,brown,combination,,P453253,Vegan Milk Moisturizer,MILK MAKEUP,38
1859993604,5,1,1,2,0,2,12/7/2022,"I have very dry and sensitive skin. This has been such a great find. I haven't had any issues with acne since starting to use it and I find that my skin looks smooth and glowing. No flakey bits on my nose. I also don't have any issue layering makeup over top of it.  That said, if you have normal skin, this would not be the right product for you.",,,blue,dry,blonde,P453253,Vegan Milk Moisturizer,MILK MAKEUP,38

It has no scent, which is nice, but considering that you need a considerable amount of product for some slip and it doesn't really leave me feeling moisturized, i'd have to say that I wouldn't buy this again.",Itâ€™s not for me and thatâ€™s ok.,,brown,normal,,P453253,Vegan Milk Moisturizer,MILK MAKEUP,38
5067041642,2,0,,0,0,0,10/21/2022,"This is product was more megh for me than I was hoping it would be. I live in a dessert climate so I love a good effectively hydrating moisturizer, The product is thick, which I normally am not against (love a good slugging) but I found that it left unnecessary residue and when worn under even just milk's own cc cream, it was breaking up underneath or not maintaining moisture. I feel like I got the same results from smearing shea butter on its own on my face for much cheaper.I would say it would make a great slugging cream, but why do this when you can get a more affordable option with more effectiveness or something of the same price with more skin benefits?Just feel like their are better vegan options, super bummed because I'm obsessed with most milk products.",Sadly disappointed,lightMedium,brown,combination,,P453253,Vegan Milk Moisturizer,MILK MAKEUP,38
